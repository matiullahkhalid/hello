  <!-- git add:
    this command will let us to tell git that i want add file once tracked that next time i wanna to commit. i need tell git what files to keep the track of 
    
    git commit:
    when i say git commit i am going to tell my repository ,i would like to save a snapshot of the current state of my repository,keeping the track of changes that have been made to the file that i added 
    and the way we run it by typing this command:
    git commit -m "message"

    the message is a commit message and it is a description in english of what changes you have made in this most recent commit .becuase overtime you work on big project you gonna make alots of commits and make a lots of changes to your programe you commit and commit again each new addition that you make to you programe on project. and  you may back refer to old commit so the message will help you on which commit what changes you made.and this make it easy to  keep the track of all changes that you made to particular git repository.

    git status:
    this command will tell us what happenning inside of my respository .

    git push:
    this command will push those changes to github online version of my repository . git push will push my changes to file from my computer  to github repository

    git pull:
    this command will get recent changes to the file on github repostory to my computer repository of project.
    
    git log:
    this command is useful when ever you need to keep track of all of changes you made to your code. keep the track of all of commits that you have been made. in the particular repository.
    and also is useful that you made a commit and you want to go back to previous commit  then you can use 'git reset' command to get back to previous commit.

    git reset:
    command to get back to previous commit. there is possible ways to use it :
    git reset --hard <commit>:
    it means reset everything backto then you have a commit hash in '<>' brackets to get back to that particular commit.
    git reset --hard origin/master:
    this command will get to the current version of my respository on github.so i wanna take my current version of my repository and reset it back to whatever is on github then i can use this 'git reset --hard origin/master'.

    Branching:
    is a git ways to repository at the same time.
    
    git branch: will tell us what branch i am currently on.

    git checkout 'name of branch' : allow us to switch between branchs .

    git checkout -b 'name of branch' : this command will make new branch of main branch

    git merge 'name of branch': this will merge the branch that we mentioned to a branch that we are currently on.example we are on main branch we use this command 'git merge style' this will merge or copy whatever  changes made to style branch to main branch.

    forking the github repository:
    fork the repository means making a copy of the original  repositoy .
    if you want to contribute to open source repository ,the first you should do is fork the repository to you own github account ,so we can fork ourselves just by clicking on the button fork then getting our own version of the repository then we can clone ,push and pull from it as well.
    the reason we may do that is that bootstrap repository while it is public but does'nt allow anyone to jus push to it that would be probably unsafe that anyone in the world just update bootstrap master code but you can do , is copy the code make a fork of it make changes on your own ,push and pull to it and then when you feel like to make a contribution you like to send back to bootstrap , you can open what is called a pull request that you are requesting that your code to be pulled in to bootstrap code.
    and people that mantain the code in particular bootstrap repository can review those pull request ,provide feedback ask for aditional changes and then when everyone is satisfied they can merge those changes into bootstrap actual code. and this is one of the key benefits of open source software , the ability to  multiple people to be working on the same piece of code.and for the community to be able to collaborate ,finding bugs ,figuring out what changes gonna make, figuring out how to improve upon existing repository and making better. 


    what is Github pages? 
    it is free way that git provides  to be able quickly take a website with html ,css and may be a little bit javascript and deploy to the internet for anyone to look at.and anyone with github account is allowed to create a github pages website for free and in order to do so can demonstrate it now .
    first create new repository : in repository name field write down 'username.github.io' this would be conventional name for your github website and then click on create repository button and the repository will be created.
    and the link will be provided for you copy that link and clone it ,now make your website then add it ,commit it and push it to github.and then go to github and then go to github pages or pages ,there will be a link provided for you, click on that link to load the website.
